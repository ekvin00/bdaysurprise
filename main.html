      <h2>Taif, aka BAKRTA5</h2>
      <p>
       Happy Birthday!! <br>
       Another year of managing you, another year I'm happy to call you bestie! My go to person if I ever want to have an unfiltered conversation. Someone I can just talk to freely, about the most dumbest of things, or the confidential things I'm not suppose to share, you're always there for the tea!<br>
       It goes without saying how appreciated you are and how I enjoy our interactions every single day. You got some exciting days ahead, and I couldn't be more excited for you. Keep on being you, stop underselling yourself,
       you are an incredible person, and I truely appreciate the friendship we have. You always got my back and I got yours. Keep being TAIF! <br>

      <h2>To Taif/BAKRTA5/Work Bestie/Bestie,</h2>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs really happening. You're finally leaving <b><i>me</i></b> for AML! CONGRATSSSSS üéâ<br>

        From all the unfiltered convos we have, to all the finessing we do at work. I truely can not imagine how I could have survived without our boss/bestie relationship. It's hard to believe it's only been 2.5 years and the impact you've had on my life through all HIGHS and LOWS, you were there! I'll always think back and appreciate those times you were there for me as a friend! All the Tiktoks, reels, chats and YAPS, real birthdays, fake birthday, trolls, ubereats, costco, car rides, breaks, and just your company, I can't imagine how boring life would've been. I hope it continues and doesn't stop just cause you'r leaving meeeeeeeeeee. I will miss the anchor days (sooo much), the random Teams calls, the random telepathic jokes we make when we hear someone talk, the inside jokes we have through Discord, I'll miss it all (I'm sure I forgot a lot of things too!).<br>

        I can't wait to see you crush it in AML. I am sure you will do well and I'm sure everyone will love you there just as much as we love and appreciate you here. Don't undersell yourself, and you don't need reassurance, you got this! I'm exicted for your next four months of work, and even more exciting 2 years ahead. You deserve all the good things coming your way and I can't wait to see you succeed! YOU ARE GOALS!! INSHALLAH! <br>
    
        I appreciate everything you've done for me, and if I could, I would go back in time and go through it all again. And just know that no one can ever replace you!! ü•π Thank you TAIF for being unique and the best work bestie anyone could ask for! üíØ  

       
       
        <em>Your Big Boss, Ex-Manager and Work Bestie, Kevin</em> ü´°ü´∞<br>
